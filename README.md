# Machine Learning Labs
This repository contains my Machine Learning lab work and experiments created during my college coursework and self-learning.
These notebooks focus on understanding ML concepts through hands-on implementation using Python.

## What this repository includes
- Supervised learning models (Regression, Classification)
- Data preprocessing and visualization
- Model training and evaluation
- Real datasets and experiments

## Tech Stack
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook (Anaconda)
- NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn

## Goal
I am building this repository as part of my preparation for Google Summer of Code (GSoC) 2026 and open-source contributions in ML and data science.
Each folder contains one ML experiment with code, results, and explanations.
